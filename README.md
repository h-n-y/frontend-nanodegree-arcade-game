Help Jack find the candy corn he lost while trick-or-treating! Created for a course I took with [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com).

## Setup  

You'll need to have a local server environment set up to play this game. If you don't already have a local server environment set up, [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info) is a good option for getting you up and running.

## Installation

Once your local server environment is set up, clone this repository to your computer. If you're using MAMP, clone the repository into the htdocs folder:

```
$ cd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs
$ git clone https://github.com/h-n-y/trick-or-treat.git
```

Navigate to the index.html file, open it in your favorite browser, and you're good to go!

## Current Issues

* If you're using Safari, the text in the first popover you see is rendered in a basic sans-serif font and is poorly formatted. Safari seems to be loading the game before the correct font is downloaded, resulting in the poor formatting. No other negative effects to gameplay.
