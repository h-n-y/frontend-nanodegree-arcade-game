===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## Setup  

You'll need to have a local server environment set up to play this game. If you don't already have a local server environment set up, [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info) is a good option for getting you up and running.

## Installation

Once your local server environment is set up, clone this repository to your computer. If you're using MAMP, clone the repository into the htdocs folder:

```
$ cd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs
$ git clone https://github.com/h-n-y/trick-or-treat.git
```

Navigate to the index.html file, open it in your favorite browser, and you're good to go!

## Current Issues 

* If you're using Safari, the text in the first popover you see is rendered in a basic sans-serif font and is poorly formatted. Safari seems to be loading the game before the correct font is downloaded, resulting in the poor formatting. No other negative effects to gameplay.
