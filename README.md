## Setup  

You'll need to have a local server environment set up to play this game. If you don't already have a local server environment set up, [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info) is a good option for getting you up and running.

## Installation

Once your local server environment is set up, clone this repository to your computer. If you're using MAMP, clone the repository into the htdocs folder:

```
$ cd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs
$ git clone https://github.com/h-n-y/trick-or-treat.git
```

Navigate to the index.html file, open it in your favorite browser, and you're good to go!

## How to Play

Jack must progress to the finish location in each level to find his lost candy corn. The finish is conspicuously marked with a yellow star. Navigate Jack around obstacles and spooky adversaries to reach the finish in each level.


#### Controls
* **move up**     - up arrow key
* **move down**   - down arrow key
* **move left**   - left arrow key
* **move right**  - right arrow key

* **dismiss popover** - space bar

Watch out for costumes frightened children have abandoned along the way - they might help Jack on his journey!

Good luck!

## Current Issues

* If you're using Safari, the text in the first popover you see is rendered in a basic sans-serif font and is poorly formatted. Safari seems to be loading the game before the correct font is downloaded, resulting in the poor formatting. No other negative effects to gameplay.
